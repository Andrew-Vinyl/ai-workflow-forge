# 💳 Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) System Documentation

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Team members using shared API keys means Andrew pays for everyone's usage out of pocket.

**Solution**: Each team member can add their own API credentials while still having access to shared fallback keys.

## 🏗️ How It Works

### **1. Personal Credentials (Recommended)**
- Team members add their own API keys
- Their usage charges their own accounts
- Complete cost isolation
- Full control over their spending

### **2. Shared Credentials (Fallback)**
- Andrew's keys available as backup
- Used when personal keys fail or aren't configured
- Clear cost attribution to shared budget

### **3. Smart Routing**
- System automatically chooses which credentials to use
- User preferences control the decision
- Transparent cost tracking

## 🔧 User Experience

### **For Team Members**

#### **Adding Personal Keys**
1. Open Secure Credential Manager
2. Click "Add Your API Key"
3. Choose service (Anthropic, OpenAI, ClickUp)
4. Enter friendly name and API key
5. Set optional monthly budget
6. Choose if it's their primary key

#### **Usage Preferences**
- **"Use My Personal Key"** - Always use their own (recommended)
- **"Use Shared Team Key"** - Always use Andrew's (charges Andrew)
- **"Ask Each Time"** - Prompt for each request

#### **Fallback Options**
- Enable fallback to shared keys if personal key fails
- Ensures workflows don't break due to quota/billing issues

### **For Andrew (Admin)**

#### **Cost Control**
- No surprise charges from team usage
- Clear visibility into who's using what
- Option to provide shared access when needed

#### **Team Management**
- See who has personal keys configured
- Monitor shared key usage
- Set team-wide policies

## 💰 Cost Attribution Examples

### **Scenario 1: Team Member with Personal Key**
```
User: Sarah
Service: Anthropic Claude
Preference: "Use My Personal Key"
Result: Sarah's API key used → Sarah pays
```

### **Scenario 2: Team Member without Personal Key**
```
User: Mike
Service: OpenAI GPT-4
Preference: "Use Shared Team Key"
Result: Andrew's API key used → Andrew pays
```

### **Scenario 3: Personal Key Fails, Fallback Enabled**
```
User: Sarah
Service: Anthropic Claude
Personal Key: Over quota
Fallback: Enabled
Result: Andrew's API key used → Andrew pays (with notification)
```
