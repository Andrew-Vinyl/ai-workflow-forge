# Example Experiment - 2024-01-01

## Objective
Test multi-agent coordination between ClickUp Controller and Schema Builder agents.

## Hypothesis
Agents can effectively communicate through structured JSON messages to coordinate complex workflows.

## Setup
- ClickUp Controller in `task_manager` mode
- Schema Builder for data validation
- Test data: Sample task creation workflow

## Test Cases
1. Create task with valid data
2. Create task with invalid data (test error handling)
3. Update task status through agent coordination
4. Generate report on task completion

## Results
- [ ] Test case 1: Pending
- [ ] Test case 2: Pending
- [ ] Test case 3: Pending
- [ ] Test case 4: Pending

## Notes
- Document any unexpected behaviors
- Track performance metrics
- Note areas for improvement

## Next Steps
- Implement actual test cases
- Set up automated testing
- Document best practices
